# About Me
Hi, I'm Zhenyang Tang — part economist, part storyteller, part accidental songwriter. By day, I'm an associate professor of finance at Clark University. By night, you'll find me working on research papers, songs, or other creative projects — sometimes with a bit too much tea and a bit too little sleep. 

## My Research
My research focuses on insider trading, ESG and business ethics, and the fascinating dynamics of financial markets - from AI to asset bubbles. I love digging into data to uncover the stories markets tell - and sometimes the ones they try to hide. 

## My Teaching
I teach Financial Management, Investment Management, and Mergers & Acquisitions at Clark University. I've also delivered finance-related lectures or talks at other universities and organizations. I love exchanging thoughts and ideas with students, and my classroom is a place where theory meets the real world, and where curiosity is just as important as equations. I'm honored to have twice received my school's Best Undergraduate Professor award. 

## Outside Academia
I've written several original songs and a handful of detective stories. Whether I'm crafting melodies or mysteries, I'm drawn to creating worlds that spark curiosity and invite people to explore. 


# 关于我

你好，我是唐镇洋。一半是经济学家，一半是故事讲述者，偶尔还是“不小心”写歌的人。白天，我是克拉克大学的金融副教授；晚上，我常常沉浸在研究论文、歌曲或其他创作项目中——通常茶喝得有点多，睡觉却有点少。

我的研究领域包括内幕交易、ESG与商业伦理，以及金融市场中不断涌现的新现象——从人工智能到资产泡沫。我喜欢在数据中挖掘故事，有时是揭开市场想要隐藏的那一面。

在克拉克大学，我教授《财务管理》《投资管理》和《并购》课程，并曾在多所大学和机构进行金融相关的讲座与演讲。我的课堂是理论与实践交汇的地方，好奇心和公式一样重要。我也曾两次获得本校的“最佳本科教学奖”。
学术之外

我创作过多首原创歌曲，也写过几篇侦探故事。无论是旋律还是谜案，我都热衷于构建能够激发好奇心、引人探索的世界。
