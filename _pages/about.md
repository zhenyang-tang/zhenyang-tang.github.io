# About Me
Hi, I'm Zhenyang Tang — part economist, part storyteller, part accidental songwriter. By day, I'm an associate professor of finance at Clark University. By night, you'll find me working on research papers, songs, or other creative projects — sometimes with a bit too much tea and a bit too little sleep. 

## My Research
My research focuses on insider trading, ESG and business ethics, and the fascinating dynamics of financial markets - from AI to asset bubbles. I love digging into data to uncover the stories markets tell - and sometimes the ones they try to hide. 

## My Teaching
I teach Financial Management, Investment Management, and Mergers & Acquisitions at Clark University. I've also delivered finance-related lectures or talks at other universities and organizations. I love exchanging thoughts and ideas with students, and my classroom is a place where theory meets the real world, and where curiosity is just as important as equations. I'm honored to have twice received my school's Best Undergraduate Professor award. 

## Outside Academia
I've written several original songs and a handful of detective stories. Whether I'm crafting melodies or mysteries, I'm drawn to creating worlds that spark curiosity and invite people to explore.
